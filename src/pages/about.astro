        There are many ways to describe who I am, but none of them ever feel complete. For now, this will do: I am a software engineer with a focus on backend systems, and a computer science student who is still learning how to think—about machines, about people, and about life itself.
      </p>

        I often find myself curious, confused, and occasionally lost. Not in a dramatic way, but in the quiet sense of questioning where one is going and why. That restlessness pushes me to travel, to read books, and to learn things that have nothing to do with productivity or career growth. Perhaps this is my form of meditation: seeking meaning through movement, reflection, and knowledge.

        Lately, my relationship with software engineering has changed. It’s not that the interest is gone—technology still fascinates me—but I no longer see it as the sole center of my identity. Whether this shift is influenced by the rise of AI or simply by time, I’m not entirely sure. What I do know is that I’m searching for something deeper: a sense of self, a direction, a reason beyond writing efficient code or building scalable systems.

        This website exists as a trace of that journey. It is a place where I document what I learn, what I build, what I think, and what I experience along the way. Some entries may be technical, others philosophical, and some may simply be fragments of thought. Consistency is still a struggle—but sincerity is not. I write here not because I have all the answers, but because I’m trying to ask better questions.

        If you’re reading this, perhaps you are searching too. If so, welcome. We might be walking different paths, but we are likely asking the same things.
